# Agent Workflows Update

## New Workflow Added: Bidirectional Style Transfer Training

### Overview
Added a sophisticated workflow for creating synthetic training data that enables any image-to-image model to learn style transfer capabilities from text-to-image models.

### Workflow Details

**Name**: Bidirectional Style Transfer Training  
**ID**: `style-transfer-training`  
**Icon**: ðŸ”„

### Process Steps

1. **Style Generation** (Text-to-Image + Style LoRA)
   - Generate 20+ diverse images in a specific art style
   - Ensures consistent aesthetic across dataset
   - Works with any text-to-image model
   - Quality over quantity - diverse prompts for better coverage

2. **Realistic Conversion** (Image-to-Image Editor)
   - Takes styled images as input
   - Uses prompt "make realistic" or similar
   - Creates photorealistic versions of the styled content

3. **Data Pair Inversion**
   - Creates bidirectional training pairs
   - Styled â†’ Realistic mapping
   - Realistic â†’ Styled mapping
   - Ensures model learns both directions

4. **LoRA Creation** (LoRA Trainer)
   - Creates LoRA from the synthetic dataset
   - Teaches style application AND removal
   - Results in versatile image editor LoRA

### Use Cases

1. **Style Transfer to Any Image Editor**
   - Bring anime styles to realistic image editors
   - Add artistic styles not in original training data
   - Enable consistent style application

2. **De-stylization Capabilities**
   - Remove artistic styles from images
   - Convert stylized art to photorealistic
   - Useful for reference image preparation

3. **Cross-Model Knowledge Transfer**
   - Transfer capabilities between different architectures
   - Bring text-to-image styles to image editors
   - Unify style capabilities across models

### Technical Benefits

- **No Manual Annotation**: Fully automated dataset creation
- **Bidirectional Learning**: Single model handles both directions
- **Quality Control**: Synthetic data ensures consistency
- **Scalable**: Can generate unlimited training pairs

### Example Implementations

1. **Anime Style Transfer**
   ```
   Text-to-Image: Any anime model â†’ Anime characters
   Image-to-Image: Convert to realistic photos
   Result: LoRA that can anime-fy or de-anime-fy any image
   ```

2. **Artistic Style Transfer**
   ```
   Text-to-Image: Any model + Makoto Shinkai LoRA
   Image-to-Image: Remove artistic style
   Result: LoRA that applies/removes specific art styles
   ```

3. **Game Asset Stylization**
   ```
   Text-to-Image: Generate game art style assets
   Image-to-Image: Convert to photorealistic
   Result: LoRA for game asset style conversion
   ```

This workflow represents a breakthrough in democratizing style transfer capabilities, allowing any image-to-image model to learn from the vast ecosystem of text-to-image style models!
