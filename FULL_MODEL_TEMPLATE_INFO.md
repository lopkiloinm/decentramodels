# Full Model Template Info

## Purpose
This template contains ALL models available on the DecentraModels platform, ready for you to fill in the descriptive fields.

## Key Points
- **All models are open source** - that's the core principle of DecentraModels
- **Architecture field** - Now preserves the actual base model name (SDXL, Illustrious XL, WAN-2.2, etc.) instead of limiting to just a few
- **Source field** - Set to 'community' for all models since we're focused on open source
- **612+ models included**:
  - Models from models.csv
  - Models from comprehensive_ai_models.csv
  - 35 Style LoRAs
  - 48 Character LoRAs

## Diverse Architectures Include
- SDXL and variants
- Illustrious XL
- NoobAI XL
- Pony Diffusion V6
- FLUX
- WAN-2.2
- HunyuanVideo
- Qwen2-VL
- Stable Diffusion 1.5
- And many more open source architectures

## To Generate
Run: `node generate_full_template.js`

This will create `full_model_template.csv` with all models and empty descriptive fields for you to research and fill in.
