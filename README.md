# DecentraModels - A Decentralized AI Model Hub

DecentraModels is a censorship-resistant hub for discovering, sharing, and running AI models. It's built for both the AI community and developers who need permanent, reliable access to creative assets.

### The Problem: Model Loss is Permanent

Niche AI communities, like those on Reddit, have highlighted a critical flaw in centralized platforms (e.g., Civitai): when a creator deletes their account, all of their models, LoRAs, and checkpoints are permanently lost. This erases countless hours of community work and valuable assets.

### The Solution: Permanent Storage & Integrated Wallets

DecentraModels solves this by leveraging a web3 stack:

*   **Walrus for Large File Storage (LFS):** Every model is stored on Walrus, a decentralized storage network. This ensures that models are permanent and can never be deleted by a single party. It provides content-addressed immutability, solving the model loss problem at its core.

*   **Dynamic for Auth & Wallets:** We use the Dynamic SDK to kill two birds with one stone. It provides seamless, multi-chain wallet authentication for users and a direct path for future on-chain payments or token-gated features, simplifying the entire user experience.
